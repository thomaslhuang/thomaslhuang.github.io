          <p>Over the past few years, many artists have started to use what's called "neural network software" to create works of art.<br>Users input existing images into the software, which has been programmed to analyze them, learn a specific aesthetic and spit out new images that artists can curate. By manipulating the inputs and parameters of these models, artists can produce a range of interesting and evocative images.<br>This work has gained widespread recognition through gallery shows, media coverage and two high-profile art auctions.<br>As an academic researcher, developer of artistic technology and amateur artist, seeing artists embrace new technology to create new forms of expression always thrills me.<br>But, like previous groundbreaking art movements, neural network art raises difficult questions: How do we think of authorship and ownership when these artworks come from the contributions of so many different creative individuals and algorithms? How do we ensure that all the artists involved are treated fairly?</p>

          <p>Imagine a computer capable of creating original art that looks as human-generated as the work appearing at major art fairs. That’s what a new study from a team at the Art and Artificial Intelligence Lab at Rutgers University is attempting to achieve. Their findings, published in June during the International Conference on Computational Creativity in Atlanta, are impressive.<br>“Since the dawn of Artificial Intelligence, scientists have been exploring the machine’s ability to generate human-level creative products such as poetry, stories, jokes, music, paintings, etc., as well as creative problem solving,” the paper notes. “The results [of our study] show that human subjects could not distinguish art generated by the proposed system from art generated by contemporary artists and shown in top art fairs.”<br>The new study builds on two 2015 papers from the Rutgers Art and AI lab on an algorithm that was able to identify the artist, genre, and style of works of art—a computer art historian of sorts. The computer had some surprising findings, drawing new connections between compositions painted decades apart by artists working in different styles. It also evaluated works and found that the famed Mona Lisa ranked lower on the creativity scale than other, less well-known works by Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

          <p>Following Christie’s tremendously successful and much-debated inclusion of an AI artwork in an auction last October—selling it for 43 times its estimate—the auction house’s archrival, Sotheby’s, is now preparing to test these uncanny waters by selling a work powered by artificial intelligence too. Heading to auction in Sotheby’s day sale in London on March 6, the occasion reaffirms a brave new fact of the art market: AI art is not going away.<br>This time, the artwork in question is an installation by Mario Klingemann, an early adopter of the field in which computer technology meets art—a movement the artist dubs “neurography.”</p>

          <p>Training algorithms to generate art is, in some ways, the easy part. You feed them data, they look for patterns, and they do their best to replicate what they’ve seen. But like all automatons, AI systems are tireless and produce a never-ending stream of images. The tricky part, says German AI artist Mario Klingemann, is knowing what to do with it all.<br>“For me, this potential is what makes it both interesting and difficult,” Klingemann tells The Verge. “It feels almost wrong to just pick a single thing [that the program produces]. Because, yes, it can create a lot of images, but it’s more magical to see it at work.”<br>Seeing this process is exactly what Klingemann has achieved with Memories of Passersby I, his video installation that’s due to be auctioned at Sotheby’s this week. This marks the second piece of AI art to be sold at a major auction house. Memories consists of two screens, each using AI to generate a portrait every few seconds. Every image is unique and morphs seamlessly into its successor. It’s like watching a lava lamp made of human faces.</p>

          <p>As AI becomes an unstoppable force, it raises some difficult questions about the future role of humans in an increasingly automated world. Initial studies are showing that we can add the most value by focusing on four key areas: critical thinking, problem solving, managing human interactions, and above all else, expressing creativity. In short, our future role involves embracing these last bastions of human exclusivity and becoming more “human.”<br>But just last month, AI-generated art arrived on the world auction stage under the auspices of Christie’s, proving that artificial intelligence can not only be creative but also produce world class works of art—another profound AI milestone blurring the line between human and machine.<br>Naturally, the news sparked debates about whether the work produced by Paris-based art collective Obvious could really be called art at all. Popular opinion among creatives is that art is a process by which human beings express some idea or emotion, filter it through personal experience and set it against a broader cultural context—suggesting then that what AI generates at the behest of computer scientists is definitely not art, or at all creative.</p>

          <p>AI art is having a moment. There are record-breaking auctions, artistic controversies, and debates about the nature of creativity But here’s something new: an AI-generated sculpture made from the ground remains of the computer used to design it.<br>It’s the work of New York artist Ben Snell, and is currently up for sale at London auction house Phillips. It’s perhaps the third signification auction of AI art in recent months, but it’s the first sculpture to go under the hammer. Christie’s sold a printed AI portrait last October while Sotheby’s auctioned a video installation of AI art back in March.</p>

          <p>he images are huge and square and harrowing: a form, reminiscent of a face, engulfed in fiery red-and-yellow currents; a head emerging from a cape collared with glitchy feathers, from which a shape suggestive of a hand protrudes; a heap of gold and scarlet mottles, convincing as fabric, propping up a face with grievous, angular features. These are part of “Faceless Portraits Transcending Time,” an exhibition of prints recently shown at the HG Contemporary gallery in Chelsea, the epicenter of New York’s contemporary-art world. All of them were created by a computer.<br>The catalog calls the show a “collaboration between an artificial intelligence named AICAN and its creator, Dr. Ahmed Elgammal,” a move meant to spotlight, and anthropomorphize, the machine-learning algorithm that did most of the work. According to HG Contemporary, it’s the first solo gallery exhibit devoted to an AI artist.</p>
