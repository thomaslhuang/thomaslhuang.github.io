				<p><span class="you">You</span> are in New York. A man in a van becomes aggravated, he drives into a nearby glass storefront. The impact creates a fist-sized hole that begins to spurt blood. <span class="you">You</span> run. As you are running, <span class="you">You</span> hear the man yell louder and louder. <span class="you">You</span> turn the corner—gunshots are fired. <span class="you">You</span> keep running. First down an avenue, then you turn the corner and run towards downtown. <span class="you">You</span> can still hear gunshots. The sky turns dark and smoke begins to fill the air. <span class="you">You</span> hail a taxi. <span class="you">You</span> and get in with another passenger. <span class="you">You</span> embrace.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> have four-inch long hairs all over <span class="you">your</span> back and sides. <span class="you">You</span> are horrified.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> shattered <span class="you">your</span> entire iPhone Xs screen. <span class="you">You</span> are horrified.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> combed out 2-inch diameter flakes of skin off <span class="you">your</span> head. <span class="you">You</span> are impressed and satisfied by the results.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> are at home. In <span class="you">your</span> own bathroom, <span class="you">You</span> sit, and feel a strange prick on <span class="you">your</span> leg. <span class="you">You</span> stand up, and look down to see a pile of assorted objects. <span class="you">You</span> sit back down. another prick. <span class="you">You</span> have twice stabbed <span class="you">your</span> inner thigh with a wooden skewer. the surrounding area is already yellowed and bruised, <span class="you">your</span> skin peeling and rotting. <span class="you">You</span> dial <span class="you">your</span> mother’s number even though she is just one room over. <span class="you">You</span> can hardly speak. all you can do is whisper is help you, help you. she laughs it off and says she in the middle of something. <span class="you">You</span> continue to beg help you, help you... only then does she realize the urgency of the situation as <span class="you">your</span> dad begins to shout in a panic. <span class="you">You</span> hear footsteps approach.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> had a dream last night, but you can’t remember much about it. It had to do with tainted bread.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> have vitiligo.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> are playing a video game. <span class="you">Your</span> dad calls you over to go swimming. He’s bought new towels. Light green, light yellow, light blue, blue and green striped towels. <span class="you">Your</span> younger cousin is playing a card game that she’s just bought some expansion cards to.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> impaled <span class="you">your</span> foot through <span class="you">your</span> shoe.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> are at home, sleeping. there’s someone else in <span class="you">your</span> bed. <span class="you">You</span> are comforted by that. <span class="you">You</span> hear a woman scream outside. <span class="you">Your</span> bedfellow asks you “did you hear that?” <span class="you">You</span> acknowledge it, but you are unfazed. <span class="you">You</span> get up to use the restroom.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> have been crying in <span class="you">your</span> dreams, something you can’t quite bring <span class="you">your</span> to do while awake.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> are at home. At the dinner table, with <span class="you">your</span> parents and <span class="you">your</span> cousin. She looks different; grotesque and horrifying. As if she had gotten a monstrous plastic surgery job and a terrible makeover. Like a gargoyle or something.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> drop <span class="you">your</span> phone. The screen does not crack; instead, the case begins to melt off the phone.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> are in London for the first time. <span class="you">You</span> know because you see a red phone booth.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> are going to the gym. <span class="you">You</span> have a rolling suitcase with you. Before you get to the door, there is a small set of stairs. At the top of these set of stairs is an elderly woman in a crop top and short shorts doing yoga. <span class="you">You</span> ask if you can pass, but she says no. <span class="you">You</span> grow agitated, but she does not move. Sometime later, <span class="you">You</span> push <span class="you">your</span> way through. Then you remember sitting at a table, discussing with friends, joking about how she is the gatekeeper of the gym.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> are playing a role playing video game. In the game, you are simulating the medieval era. <span class="you">You</span> are walking along a bridge, and see a bear. <span class="you">You</span> run, and the bear chases after you, but gives up after about fifteen seconds and chases someone else. <span class="you">You</span> turn around, and the bear begins chasing you again. The bear continues to switch its attention between you and the other person. Eventually, you make <span class="you">your</span> way into the bottom floor of a tower, certain that the bear will not follow. It does. The bear chases both of us up the tower. He mauls the other person. <span class="you">You</span> run up to the only window at the top of the tower, throw a rope out the window and slide down, relieved to have escaped the bear. <span class="you">You</span> turn around to see the limp body of the other person rests on the ground in front of you and the bear is sliding down the rope. <span class="you">You</span> run down a long bridge and the bear chases. <span class="you">You</span> are cornered, and you are mauled. <br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> start a new game, this time set in an English university. <span class="you">You</span> are walking through courtyards, growing thickly with trees. <span class="you">You</span> peer into a classroom as a class is dismissed. Old books fill the wall floor to ceiling. It’s beautiful.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> are at home. <span class="you">Your</span> brother claims that one of his high school friends is a stalker. He’s devised a plan to capture her at <span class="you">your</span> own house. Somehow, <span class="you">your</span> parents have agreed to this. She is supposed to arrive around 12:30am. <span class="you">You</span> attempt to sleep through it, but wake up at 9:30pm. <span class="you">Your</span> brother asks you how to get into the attic. <span class="you">You</span> don’t know.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> and <span class="you">your</span> dad got into another argument. <span class="you">You</span> are distraught, he never understands you.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> were challenged to transliterate the longest word in the English language into Spanish. Despite seeing several misspellings with <span class="you">your</span> own eyes, <span class="you">your</span> friends told you it was correct.<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span> are not me. <span class="you">You</span> are bowling. There is something a bit off about the lane, and the game isn’t going well. <span class="you">You</span> see a man in another lane packing up to leave, so you go over. Without speaking to him, you grab the nearest bowling ball and effortlessly toss it, netting a strike. <span class="you">You</span> overhear a family. A father asks, “how do you like these lanes?” The younger sister replies, “they’re good!” And the older brother says, “yeah, they’re pretty good.”<br><br>
				<span class="you">You</span>’re at <span class="you">your</span> lovers’ house. They had gotten a new puppy a couple months ago. By the time you’ve met the puppy, he’s already fully grown. <span class="you">You</span>’re in their bed. <span class="you">You</span> call one of them. He answers. <span class="you">You</span> say nothing, and shove the phone under the covers. Silence. 30 seconds pass. <span class="you">You</span> don’t know what to say. He says, frustrated, “you haven’t even said anything!” <span class="you">You</span> realize he is sitting at the table just outside the bedroom. <span class="you">You</span> say nothing. <span class="you">You</span> can’t say anything.</p>
