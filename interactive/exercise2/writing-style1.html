		<p><i>?Where</i> is a project about form and figure, about memory and witness. Designed and built for <i>Halves: Senior Thesis Works in Progress</i>, and installed in the Yale School of Art Green Gallery.</p>
		<p><i>?Where</i> utilizes two Raspberry Pi Zero Ws, one attached to a camera on a balcony overlooking the gallery space, and another connected to a thermal receipt printer located more centrally in the gallery.</p>
		<p>Every thirty seconds, the camera takes a photo of the gallery and compares it to an initial image of the space. Then a mask is created<sup>1</sup>, isolating any new objects that have entered the space, highlighting the discrepancies between the two photos.</p>
		<p>The mask is then uploaded to Dropbox, where the Pi attached to the printer periodically checks to see if a new image has been uploaded. When it finds a new mask, the image is downloaded and printed, creating a relatively accurate snapshot of the gallery at that moment.<sup>2,3</sup></p>

		<p class="text-center"><i>Notes</i></p>
		<p>1&emsp;The mask is created by subtracting the new image from the initial image, and then thresholding the result.<br>2&emsp;Both the camera and printer scripts were written in Python. The <i>Dropbox-Uploader</i> bash script used in these scripts to upload and retrieve masks was written by Andrea Fabrizi.<br>3&emsp;Materials: Raspberry Pi Zero W, thermal printer, thermal printer paper.</p>
